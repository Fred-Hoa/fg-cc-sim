## Requirements
### Hardware
I ran the simulations on a Intel Core i7 CPU 3.40 GHz x 8 stationary computer running Ubuntu 16.04.
### Software
This is the software required to run the simulations. In bracket is the version it has been tested with.
* [FlightGear](http://www.flightgear.org/download/) [v2017.2.1]
* [JSBSim](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsbsim/) [v1.0]
* Python 3 [3.6]

Some optional packages
* [PyQT](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt) and [PyQTgraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/) for plotting and GUI
